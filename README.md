# Module 4 Challenge - Code Quiz

## Description

Created a code quiz to be used by bootcamp students to test their knowledge. Bootcamp students who choose to take this quiz will have 60 seconds to answer the questions that appear on-screen. Every correct answer will reward the student with 5 points. However, every incorrect answer will cause the time left to be reduced by 10 seconds. After the game is over, players will then be able to save their initials along with their score which will be displayed on the high scores page.
